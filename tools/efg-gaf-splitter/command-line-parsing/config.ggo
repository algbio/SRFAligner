version	"devel"
package	"efg-gaf-splitter"
purpose	"Program to split GAF exact matches into node matches that are valid GraphAligner seeds and eventually flip to the reverse complement representation"
usage	"efg-gaf-splitter graph.gfa seeds.gaf"

description	"The program takes in input a GFA graph and a set of GAF exact matches, and outputs in stdout the matches split into node matches, filtering node matches of length 1. If the query id in the GAF entries starts with prefix 'rev_', the match is considered to be between the reverse complement of the read and the graph: such prefix is removed and the GAF entries in output are flipped to be between the forward strand of the read and the reverse complement nodes of the graph."
